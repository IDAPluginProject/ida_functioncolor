# ida_functioncolor
 IDA Plugin to colorize function definition in pseudocode.

## Note

- This relies on user colors so it will look different than how it looks in previews.
- Might not be perfect for all functions.
- Tested only with v8.3
- Would be good to also colorize params (different color for type & name)
